### 🌱 I'm Currently Learning
#### iOS Development
- While I already have a foundation in iOS development, I'm actively pursuing mastery in this field.
- To achieve this goal, I'm currently following the [100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).
- Here are some apps I've built as part of my learning journey, each one demonstrating progress and new skills (older to newer):
  - [WeSplit](https://github.com/rafaelfagundes/WeSplit)
  - [Guess The Flag](https://github.com/rafaelfagundes/GuessTheFlag)
  - [BetterRest](https://github.com/rafaelfagundes/BetterRest)
  - [Rock, Paper & Scissors](https://github.com/rafaelfagundes/RockPaperScissors)
  - [WordScramble](https://github.com/rafaelfagundes/WordScramble)
- In each project, I strive to implement additional features and apply concepts from other languages I'm familiar with, such as JavaScript, C#, and Python. This approach helps me to accelerate my learning and draw parallels between different programming paradigms.
